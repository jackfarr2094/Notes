Demonstrate various elements of the project, postman, html, the front end you have.
If I can get things on the cloud working show that.

Things to show/mention -
Git
Postman
HTML
Springboot

Things that went well:
- Could get some of my back end working
- Got the fron end to do something
= Springboot and Postman on the whole functioned

Things that did not go well:
- Struggled with html
- Excpected a little too much of myself
- Stress

Self reflection:
- I would like to get this functioning properly
- Considering this is my first project I'm happy to have at least got something to show
- Managing my own expectations
- Ask for help from colleagues
