For loops:
- Initialisation (initialises the variable)
- Condition (checks the condition of the variable)
- Updation (updates the variable)

(Compound assignment operators)
- +=
- -=
- *=
- /=
- %=

Exercise:
To store a float as a variable in order to solve a decimal:

float A;
A = (float) 5/2;
OR
5.0F/2;

int Bill;
int Paid;
int Balance;
Bill = 1
Paid = 50
Balance = Paid - Bill

if Balance/20 then display "20 =" Balance % 20
if Balance/10 then display "10 =" Balance % 10

DECLARE THE VARIABLES

Fifty, Twenty, Ten, Five, Two, One;
		Fifty = 50, Twenty = 20, Ten = 10, Five = 5, Two = 2, One = 1;

What you should have done for the "if" statements

if (balance>=50) 
	Fifty = Balance/50 {
