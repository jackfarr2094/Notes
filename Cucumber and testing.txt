Cucumber - behaviour driven development.
	- Builds on top test driven development
	- Runs our tests
	- Gherkin: takes the feature from text to test

Cucumber makes use of the given, when, then canvas:

	- Given: a pre-condition
	- When: an action is performed
	- Then: the result, that is testable.

There can be multiple givens, whens and thens.

Eg. Given I go to google.com, when I type cats into the searchbar then
	I will be displayed a webpage of cats and so on
