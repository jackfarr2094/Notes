Git Gud:

Git is a Version Control System (VCS).

Git repsoitories; places where you send and retrieve work. They can be local (on your pc) or remote
on somewhere like Github or bitbucket. Remote repositories are extremely useful on projects where there
are multiple people working on it at different times.

Workflows like this enable users to commit and pull and work on projects flexibily.

"Touch" is a unix command to create a file.
camelCase - naming syntax for naming methods and variables in Java. E.g. whadupMydude
also a syntax: PascalCase - WhadupMyDude, snake_case - whadup_my_dude, and kebab-case: whadup-my-dude

"git init": initialise the local git repository
git add . : add folder
"git status": see what is in your git repository
"git commit -m", add -m so the terminal doesn't go to the text editor screen once you commit. -m will
also allow you add a message to your commit for GitHub.
"." means this folder, so "git add ." add this folder to be commit.

LF = Line Feed, pull the paper down
CR - Carriage return
CRLF - Carriage Return Line Feed, an old typewriter term windows use for creating new lines.

To use remote repository: "git remote add origin [repository url]
				"git push -u origin master"
IN THEORY it should work but it isn't today...
