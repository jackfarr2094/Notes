Arrays:

Arrays are a variable which can stores more than one value. They have multiple locations in 
which you declare to stores values.

Numbers [0] = 15, stores 15 in location 0 of the array Numbers. 
To recall an array: Result = Numbers [0];
To declare an array: int Numbers [] = new int [10]; declares an array with 10 locations
of integers/

Arrays are fixed size once set up. You cannot remove or add locations to an array.
Array lists are like an array but you can add or remove locations.

for (i=0; i < 100; i++){
	System.out.println(Numbers [i]);
	}

	This code creates an array of numbers 0-99, stored in the array "Numbers".

for (i=0; i < Numbers.length; i++){
	System.out.println(Numbers [i]);
	}

	Gives you the number of values in the array.

Example code:

	class QaConsulting1 {
	public static void main (String xyz[])	 <---- Java will look for a string array
	int i;
	for (i=0; i < xyz.length; i++) {
	System.out.println([xyz]);
	}

		class QaConsulting1 {
	public static void main (String[] xyz) <---- String will still be the array
